        Cricket is generally viewed as the favourite sport of Indians. Sports broadcasters, national-international news media frequently claim that "cricket is like religion in India", people are crazy for the sport there, but the truth is far from it, Indians don't show up at the stadiums to witness domestic (except IPL) tournament (such as Ranji, Vijay Hazare trophy, Irani Cup etc.), non-India international matches and stadium remain empty, reason for this according to a senior figure in Indian broadcasting, "Indians don’t love cricket", "Indians love Indian cricket.</p> 
    <p>It is played between two teams of eleven players each. One team, which is batting, tries to score runs, while the other team is fielding, and tries to prevent this.

<b>Biggest Stadium In India
</b><br>
<img src="stadium.jpg" alt="stadium image"class="center" ><br>
<P>Narendra Modi Stadium (formerly known as Motera Stadium), is an international cricket stadium in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. It is currently the largest stadium in the world, with a seating capacity of 132,000 spectators.The stadium is owned by the Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA) and serves as the venue for domestic and international cricket matches. It is one of India's premier cricket stadiums and has hosted several high-profile matches, such as the 2023 Cricket World Cup final. The stadium is named in honor of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi</P>
<p><p>The plot which currently holds Narendra Modi Stadium was formerly occupied by another venue, Sardar Patel Stadium (not to be confused with numerous contemporary stadiums of the same name).[1] It served as the main arena for domestic and international cricket in the city until its demolition in 2015, hosting matches during the 1987, 1996, and 2011 ICC World Cups.In 2014, it was decided that a new stadium should be built on the same plot. The new stadium, originally named Motera Stadium, was designed by Australia's design firm Populous and built by Larsen and Toubro. It took 5 years to build, at an estimated cost of ₹800 crore (US$96 million). Once completed, the new arena replaced the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground as the world's largest cricket stadium. The stadium has 4 dressing rooms, 11 center pitches, and 2 practice grounds. The practice grounds can additionally serve as venues for domestic matches.

    The new stadium was first opened to the public in 2020 amid the Namaste Trump event. In February 2021, the stadium was renamed Narendra Modi Stadium in honour of Indian Prime Minister at the time, Narendra Modi. The prime minister had previously served as chief minister of Gujarat (2001-2014) as well as president of the GCA (2009-2014).The new stadium was officially inaugurated in 2021, with Indian President Ram Nath Kovind presiding over the event.
    
    On 24 February 2021, the stadium hosted its first Test match, when home side India played against England. It was also its first day-night test game. On 29 September 2022, the opening ceremony of the 2022 National Games of India was held in the stadium.[</p></p>

<b>Stadium Design And Faciities</b>
<p>The Narendra Modi stadium has a two tier structure and a three tier main pavilion. The arena is built on 63 acres of land and has 4 entry points, with a metro line at one of the entry points. It has 76 corporate boxes that can hold 25 persons each,[43] a 55-room clubhouse, an Olympic size swimming pool, and four dressing rooms. A food court and hospitality area is available in each spectator stand. The stadium also includes an indoor cricket academy and practice pitches, with dormitories for 40 athletes. The stadium features an LED light system on all parts of the roof's inside edge, setting it apart from most stadiums which use floodlight towers, with an effect being to reduce shadows on the pitch. The LED lights are installed on an antibacterial, fireproof canopy with PTFE membrane that covers 30 metres (98 ft) out of 55 metres (180 ft) width of the seating area. The roof was installed by Walter P Moore firm, who specifically designed it to be lightweight and separate from the seating bowls in order to make it fairly earthquake resistant.[45] Larsen and Toubro was the main building contractor of the arena; they worked in collaboration with foreign firms from Australia, Japan, Spain, United States and Italy. They assigned Australia's Populous company to design the stadium; their architect Andrew James led most of the work. </p>

 <p> The two tier structure of the Narendra Modi Stadium is supported from beneath by numerous huge Y-shaped columns, which eliminate the need for pillars inside the arena and thus gives spectators an unobstructed view of the entire field from any place in the Stadium. Each column's weight is 280 tonnes. They are about 30 meters tall, and were Precasted in huge moulds and assembled on the stadium building site. The fabric of the roof is imported from Japan, the LED lighting was installed by a Spain-based firm, and an Italian firm installed cables on which the Japanese company company fitted the roof fabric. The ground has 11 centre pitches, playing field has sensors to detect the need of water for the grass, which can automatically activate 67 fully automated underground pop-up sprinklers. The ground has Bermuda grass surface, seeds for which were purchased from the USA. The stadium has a high-tech drainage system.
stadium premises has many facilities: it has an indoor cricket practice area, badminton and tennis courts, a Squash, table tennis area, 3D projector theater and 3 practice grounds and 50 rooms.The parking lot can accommodate 3,000 cars and 10,000 two-wheelers. It has a huge ramp designed to facilitate the movement of around 60,000 people simultaneously. The arena has been designed in such a way that patrons can fill the lower tier of the stadium for smaller events to maintain the crowd atmosphere when not at full capacity.
There was a plan that the stadium would be connected to the nearest metro station by a skywalk bridge in order to decrease road congestion. It was said that construction would be completed after September 2020, as part of the Motera Metro Station project rather than the stadium's. As of November 2023, the skywalk is yet to be constructed.</p>
